_In order to find an answer, I used Google search to find list of HBCUs established to the Reconstruction Era and during    Reconstruction_. 


 _I selected the HBCUs in 2010 ans 2015 datas, and found the sum of recipients in both categories (Prior to the Reconstruction Era and During the Reconstruction Era), so I got four numbers_.


 _According to the results, the number of loan recipients prior to the Reconstruction Era decresed by 1,665, or 27.59%_.


 _According to the results, the number of loan recipients during the Reconstruction Era decreased by 14,722, or 12.66%_.


 _So, the largest change in number of loan recipients between 2010 and 2015 was in HBCUs prior to the Reconstruction Era_.
